### ClimaLite Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
   
This privacy policy applies to the ClimaLite app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Venkata B (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

2. Information We Collect
   
2.1 Location Data

As long as you give permissions, your device's location (latitude and longitude) is captured and is sent to Weather APIs to get forecast at your location and geotimezone API to get time at your location.
You can disable location services in your device settings at any time.
The app allows you to search for any location so even if you disable your device location you should be able to use the app without any issues, it is only that the 
landing page won't show weather data at your current location and instead defaults to a random location.

2.2 Technical Information
- Query Wether API for getting forecast data
- load Google Maps and option to locate your current location

3. How We Use Your Information

- Provide weather forecasts at your current location (if permission allowed) along with other locations that you search for
- We neither store your device location / timezone or any of your search history, however the above external services may capture the queried data which we don't have control of.
- Last 10 searched locations are captured and showed as an option but they are stored on your device and not on any cloud service/network, meaning you have full control on this list and delete them as needed.

4. Data Protection

Location data is anonymized and not linked to personal identifiers
App directly doesn't sell or rent your location information to third parties

5. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party weather data providers
These providers may use your device IPs or any information that you are using to query the app, we don't have control over

6. User Controls

Disable location services

Delete app data at any time

7. Children's Privacy

ClimaLite is not intended for children under 13, 

8. Data Retention

Location searches are temporary and not stored anywhere other than on your device, meaning if you uninstall or clean the app, the searched locations will be deleted
