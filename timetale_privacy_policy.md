2. Information We Collect

2.1 Location Data

With your permission, the app collects your device’s location (latitude and longitude) to retrieve the full address using third-party APIs.
You may disable location services at any time in your device settings.
Even with location disabled, you can still use all core features by manually selecting a location in Google Maps. The only limitation is that the Moments page will not automatically default to your current location.

Our app collects the following information:
- Device identifier (for analytics)
